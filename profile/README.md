# CHOAM-SaaS

This is a community-driven project that is focused around bringing as much data to players of Dune: Awakening as possible.
Amidst player-driven data handling and api exceptions, I must not fear. Fear is the mindkiller. 
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. 
I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 

### Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
